Program1: 
File Name: 1_Pointers.c
Definition: Printing all alphabets using pointers.


Program2: 
File Name: 2_StructureProgram.c
Definition: Program Definition: Accessing structure member through pointer using dynamic memory allocation
What to use: To access structure member using pointers, memory can be allocated dynamically using malloc() function defined under "stdlib.h" header file.


Program3: 
File Name: 3_FileOperation.c
Definition: File open, read, write and close operation copying file1.txt data into file2.txt
What to use:
1. fopen() function is used for opening a file.
2. fgetc() function reads the character from current pointerâ€™s position and upon successful read moves the pointer to next character in the file.
3. fputc() writes a character (an unsigned char) specified by the argument char to the specified stream and advances the position indicator for the stream.
3. The fclose() function is used for closing an opened file. As an argument you must provide a pointer to the file that you want to close.


Program4:
File Name: 4_FileMerging.c
Program Definition: Merging two files into a third file.
What to use:
Open two files in read(r) mode, copy file contents into file pointers, open third file in write(w) mode and store it to file pointer.
i.e. file1.txt + file2.txt = file3.txt


Program5:
File Name: 5_DataStructureStack.c
Definition: Stack data structure implementation.
Scenario: push, pop and display operation on stack.
